  <h2>Why I am attending Lambda School</h2>
<br><p>I decided to attend <a href="https://www.lambdaschool.com">Lambda School</a><br>
          after I had to resign in lieu of being fired from my job as
          a professional truck driver.</div><br>
          I am very creative and I found that driving for a living was<br>
          just not satisfying my need to create. This caused me to drive<br>
          very agressivley because I just wanted to get the day over with.<br>
          As you can imagine, this behavior did not sit well with my employer<br>
          and they ended up asking for my resignation.<br>
          I had been attempting to learn to code in my spare time,<br>
          but found that motivation to practice coding after sitting behind<br>
          a stearing wheel for 60 hours a week was in short supply.<br>
          So, after a couple of failed attempts to find a new driving job,<br>
          I decided I wanted to go to school for web development full time.<br>
          My wonderful partner agreed to support our household while I attend school<br>
          and that brings us to the present.<br>
          This website is for the "Launch a Website" portion of the pre-course<br>
          work that Lambda recomends students complete before class starts.
