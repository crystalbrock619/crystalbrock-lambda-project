      I wrote my first program in Basic on a Commodore 64 and I loved it. Unfortunatly, way back then we didn't have
      code editors and hours spent searching for syntax errors was so frustrating for my 10 year old self I just gave it
      up. Later, in junior high, I signed up for a summer program teaching how to code low res graphics in Basic. Again, I
      found I loved it and ended up with the most detailed project in the class.
      Still no code editors though so after the program was over I didn't continue to code. As an adult I have spent the
      last decade as a professional truck driver.
      After 10 years of driving for a living, I decided driving was just not satisfying my need to build design and
      create things.

      I had been attempting to learn Java in my spare time, but found that motivation to practice coding after sitting
      behind a steering wheel for 60 hours a week was in short supply! So, I decided I wanted to go to school for web development full time. My wonderful partner agreed to support our
      household while I attend school so I began working toward my bachelor's degree in Cybersecurity at 
      <a href="https://www.snhu.edu/">Southern New Hampshire University</a>. In my time there, I have maintained a GPA over 3.5
      and I am on track to graduate with highest Latin honors. I have made the <a href="https://meritpages.com/crystalbrock">President's List</a>a> every semester I have been enrolled. Additionally, I am an inducted member of the honor society,
      National Society of Ledership and Success (Sigma Alpha Pi).
