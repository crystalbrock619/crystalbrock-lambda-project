      I wrote my first program in Basic on a Commodore 64 and I loved it. Unfortunatly, way back then we didn't have code editors and hours spent searching for syntax errors was so frustrating for my 10 year old self I just gave it up.
      Later, in junior high, I signed up for a summer program teaching how to code low res graphics in Basic. Again, I found I loved it and ended<br>up with the most detailed project in the class.
      Still no code editors though so after the program was over I didn't continue to code.</p>

      As an adult I have spent the last decade as a professional truck driver.
      After 10 years of driving for a living, I decided driving was just not satisfying my need to build design and create things.
      I had been attempting to learn Java in my spare time, but found that motivation to practice coding after sitting behind a steering wheel for 60 hours a week was in short supply!
      So, I decided I wanted to go to school for web development full time. My wonderful partner agreed to support our household while I attend school so  I applied to <a href="https://www.lambdaschool.com">Lambda School</a> and was accepted.
